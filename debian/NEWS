fprintd (1.90.1-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  Since version 1.90.1, the format of the fingerprints database changed.

  That means that each users will have to re-enroll their fingerprints either
  using fprintd-enroll(1) or the desktop environment specific way (ie. via
  gnome-control-center if you are using GNOME).
